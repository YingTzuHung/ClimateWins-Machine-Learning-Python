# ClimateWins-Machine-Learning-Python
This project explores advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques in Python to assess weather prediction and categorization tools for mainland Europe. Additionally, it offers recommendations on the most promising Thought Experiment to pursue.
## Objective
This project investigates the hypothetical case of ClimateWins, a fictional European nonprofit organization leveraging machine learning to predict the consequences of climate change. The organization is concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, particularly over the past 10 to 20 years. Utilizing data from the past century, this project aims to:<br>
* Use machine learning to find new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years
* Identify weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe
* Determine the safest places to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years

## Key Questions
* How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
* Are there any ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI specific to this project?
* Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day?

## Data Source
* [Europe Temperature Data Set](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/da-spec-ml/Scripts/A1/Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed.csv) - This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.
